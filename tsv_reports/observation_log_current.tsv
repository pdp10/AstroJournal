Jupiter	Cnc	Planet	103x +/- SPF, 206x + SPF	Just a quick look until the sky became darker. No particular event tonight. It was very nice to see it. The two main belts revealed some subtle detail appearing like tiny shades. In particular these were more detectable in the North Equatorial Belt.  
Moon	Sgr	Satellite	103x +/- SPF	Phase 96%. No many detail were revealed. The moon is not really interesting when full. Craters and seas were detectable but not immersive. 
M57	Lyr	Pln Neb	103x	Ring nebula. The ring was visible with averted vision, but no other detail really. The contrast between the ring and the internal area is much more visible with an OIII filter. Still nice planetary nebula.
Zeta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Already split at 15x, but much nicer at 103x. 
Delta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	This is a very nice system of stars already visible at 15x. A larger triangle with a little internal triangle. Just beautiful.
Epsilon	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x, 206x	The Double Double. Epsilon 1 and 2 were easily split at 15x. At 103x it was possible to detect that both Epsilon 1 and 2 are double stars themselves. At 206x this pair of tight double stars was visible although these double stars remained very close. Same colour.
Beta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Sheliak. Splendid double already split at 15x. This was very nice at 103x. 
Beta	Cyg	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Albireo. Wonderful double. A bit tight at 15x, but very nice at 103x. One orange, the other one blue.

Sun	Tau	Star	51x +/- VPF or SPF, 72x +/- VPF, 103x +/- VPF	I enjoyed observing the Sun a lot today. There were more than 30 sunspots and also a hint of granulation when the wind became calm for short moments. Very nice day. The wind did not allow to see Sun granulation most of the time. The seeing improved after 5pm when the wind became more moderate. Many sunspots were visible. Three larger umbrae were surrounded by nice areas of penumbra. One of this had an irregular shape and the South part vanished gradually. This at all powers. It was very attractive. A central area contain 4 well defined sunspots and many little grey spots. Around the larger sunspots, there were brighter and extended areas on the Sun surface. 51x gave the best view most of the time. 72x and 103x were interesting powers but only suitable when the wind was calm, which was rare! A VPF increased the detail noticeably. Apart from reducing image brightness, I appreciate this filter because it stabilises the image, particularly under average seeing. Surprisingly I found that I prefer the view through a SPF rather than VPF. A VPF reduces image brightness, whereas a SPF improves contrast to me. Through a SPF I could see a hint of granulation at 51x even when there was moderate wind. This did not happen with a VPF. I am considering whether separate the two filters. Having them separate would also be quite comfortable when watching planets in the twilight. SPF also improved contrast for all the sunspots. This works as follows: 0 (or 180) degrees shows the brightest image, 90 (or 270) degrees shows the darkest image. For observing both planets and the Sun, I found that I prefer the view when the SPF is positioned at 45 (or 135 or 225 or 315) degrees. The image was still bright, contrast was highest than all other options and the number of details was maximised. Nagler 7mm, Vixen 5mm, and Nagler 3.5mm form my best eyepiece combination for watching the Sun with the TV-60. All of them are really useful, although the first two achieve best results almost every time. The Nagler 3.5mm can show some very nice close-up of umbrae and penumbrae.

Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
Saturn	Lib	Planet	103x	Seen during civil twilight and later in the nautical twilight. Although the seeing was not great, Saturn appeared very crisp. The rings had a very nice inclination. The Cassini division was generally not detectable. For few seconds when the seeing stabilised, a hint of dimmer colour was visible on the external part of the rings. A nice belt was visible all the time in the North hemisphere (North Equatorial Belt) of the planet. Titan was visible too. The view was really nice generally. Possibly due to the seeing, but I preferred the view when the sky was darker. 
Alpha	Sco	Star	15x	Antares. Lovely red star. I could see the Airy disc and difraction rings very nicely. Antares is one of my favourite stars. 
M107	Ser	Glob CL	15x, 51x	From Han, Zeta Oph, go slightly South and see a triangle. M103 is on the outside of one of the verteces. It was barely visible at 15x, also due to the bright sky. At 51x was detectable but still with difficulty. Not much to see. Just a grey smudge visible with averted vision.
M10	Oph	Glob CL	15x, 51x	Nice globular cluster. It does not have nearby stars, but is relatively large. Stars are not really visible, but the cluster appear with some hint of granulation particularly detectable on the outside.
M12	Oph	Glob CL	15x, 51x	Like M10, this is another nice globular cluster. Somehow I preferred it to M10 because of the presence of surrounding close stars at east. I believe this cluster is slightly bigger than M10, or at least it seemed so. Like M10, a hint of granulation was detectable. 
IC4665 - Cr349	Oph	Opn CL	15x	Summer Beehive Cluster. Amazing open cluster of large size above the star Cebalrai. A pleasure to see with a low power eyepiece. Stars have similar colours and magnitude, but the shape is nice.
NGC6633	Sct	Opn CL	15x	From 71-72 Oph to East, NGC6633 and Cr386 appear in succession. Both are sufficiently large to be appreciable with a low power eyepiece. They are quite rich in stars. 
IC4756 - Cr386	Sct	Opn CL	15x	Graff's cluster. See above
Epsilon	Lyr	Dbl star	51x	The Double Double. I could not split the two. The image suggested a possible elongation of the two stars, but this was not obvious. I would not have detected it if I had not known that they are doubles. I carefully focused inward and outward to reach the optimum, but this was not sufficient. 
Beta	Sco	Mlt star	51x	Acrab or Graffias. Very fine multiple star system at 51x. The two stars have different colour and brightness. If I remember correctly the small one was blue. They were split but still quite tight. At 70x they should be split clearer. 
M57	Lyr	Pln Neb	51x	It was lovely to see this planetary nebulae at 1.2mm exit pupil. The ring was clearly visible and the size was acceptable. No colour of course, but averted vision showed this object pretty well, although it was visible also via direct observation. As expected, the Nalger 7mm is perfect for this target and I expect that is more than adeguate for many other planetary nebulae.

Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
Saturn	Lib	Planet	103x, 206x	Very nice view of Saturn tonight. At both 103x and 206x, the Cassini division was detectable when the sky appeared steady for few seconds. It appeared as a soft grey shade on the lateral parts of the rings. Possibly what I was seeing was the shade between the A and B rings. This was not always visible, but just for few seconds when the seeing was steady and no wind blew, the difference in colour intensity was noticeable. Titan was also visible on the South of the planet. It seemed a grey dot. The North Equatorial Belt on the planet appeared as a soft darker gradient compared to the planet equatorial zone. The North Polar Region was not clearly detectable.
Venus	Com	Planet	103x, 206x	Phase about 50%. No detail visible, but the image was sufficiently stable. A SPF would have helped, but I forgot it at home. 
Jupiter	Leo	Planet	103x, 206x	206x was too much for Jupiter tonight. Mostly seen it at 103x. Three moons visible, whereas the fourth seemed behind the planet. North and South Equatorial Belts were visible. On the North Hemisphere another belt was also detectable. No GRS visible.
C33 / 34 - NGC6992 / 6960	Cyg	SN Rem	15x +/- OIII, 28x +/- OIII	Veil Nebula. No visible or detectable. I carefully searched the stars and positioned at 52 Cygni. 28x +OIII seemed to show a soft transparent cloud, but I cannot say that that was the Veil Nebula. The sky was not fully transparent and dark. This might be the reason.
Epsilon	Lyr	Dbl star	103x	The Double Double. Just managed to see the two pairs, although the separation was not clear. They appeared just a tiny more than elongated stars. I am not sure, but I suspect this was more due to the Nagler 3.5mm. I will try with the Vixen 5mm next time, as generally this eyepiece delivers better views than the Naglers, on planets at least.
Beta	Sco	Mlt star	103x	Acrab or Graffias. It was clearly split, but the seeing was not very nice near the horizon and the stars light was not puntiform. The small star is blue. This double star is the top of the three stars of Scorpius.

Venus	Com	Planet	72x, 144x +/- SPF	Gorgeous with the Vixen SLV 5mm. The best view of Venus I have ever had so far. Phase was about 45%, and Venus appeared cristal clear without any glare and perfectly focused. The borders were very crisp. At 144x the planet was bigger, but no additional detail was detectable. At both 72x and 144x, I felt that at the center of the visible part of the planet, the colour was just slightly dimmer as if a soft darker cloud was there. Really beautiful. SPF did not help much with the Vixen, so I removed.
Jupiter	Leo	Planet	72x, 144x +/- SPF	Jupiter was visible with North and South Equatorial Belts and four moons. No other detail was detectable. SPF did not help with the Vixen. The planet did not appear much crisp in contrast to Venus. Also here, I preferred the view of Jupiter at 72x (without Barlow). It is as if the barlow lens introduces some imperfections which remove the additional benefit of using a Vixen vs a Nagler. The same can be said for the SPF with the Vixen. Vixen alone gave the best views (without Barlow or SPF).
Saturn	Lib	Planet	28x, 72x +/- SPF, 144x	Saturn was wonderful with the Vixen at 72x. The North Equatorial Belt was detectable particularly when in contrast with the Equatorial zone. The Cassini division was visible on the left and right parts of the rings when the planet was at the centre of the eyepiece. It appeared as a soft grey line which separated more dense rings (B rings) from lighter rings (A rings). The shadow of the planet on the ring or details on the polar region were not visible. Titan was also visible. A SPF did not help and actually degraded the image for Saturn with the Vixen. At 144x, the image degraded and was not as nice as at 72x. At 28x, the planet was very small, but the rings and the empty part between the planets and the rings were visible. Titan at South-West of the planet in the eyepiece was much brighter at this magnification (due to the larger exit pupil) and I felt a small faint dot was detectable at South-East of the planet in the eyepiece. This was closer to the planet than Titan. After checking Saturn's moons positions with Sky and Telescope software application, the only moon at that distance and position was Rhea. I am not sure I saw this moon of magnitude 10. It would be at the limit of my TV60. This dot was more visible with averted vision although it was also detectable via direct vision.
Epsilon	Lyr	Dbl star	72x	The Double Double. It was possible to see the two pairs at 72x, although to me this was not appreciable. The two pairs appeared a little bit more than elongated or just separated, but I much prefer when a double star is clearly and nicely separated. The two pairs were similarly separated. Possibly Epsilon1 (the North pair) was slightly more, but, if so, a tiny bit.
Beta	Lyr	Dbl star	28x	Sheliak. Wonderful colour double star. One orange and one blue. Really beautiful.
Delta	Lyr	Dbl star	28x	Superb multi star system. At 28x it is really bright and proportional to the field of view. I love the triangles and the overall geometry in this system of stars.
HD175634	Lyr	Dbl star	28x	This double star is relatively close to M57 and inside the parallelogram of Lyra. One star is orange, the other is blue. Similar to Sheliak but a bit dimmer.
Beta	Sco	Mlt star	28x, 72x	Acrab or Graffias. Although tight, I prefer this double star at 28x rather than 72x because of the smaller Airy disks. Very nice though. A bigger and bright orange star associated with a smaller blue star. 
Omega	Sco	Dbl star	28x, 72x	The two stars were largely more separated than Acrab double stars. A no substantial difference in colour or size was noticeable though. I did not find this target particularly interesting. Nicer at 28x.
Nu	Sco	Dbl star	28x, 72x	I am not sure I saw this. If so, it appeared as a tight double star with the same colour and quite dim. 28x was better due to the higher image brightness.
Epsilon	Boo	Dbl star	28x, 72x	Izar. I could not split this double star at 28x or 72x. I thought it was easier. Still a very nice yellow bright star. The sky was becoming less transparent on this region of the sky. Therefore I moved North.
M39	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	Quite large open cluster position at North North-East of Deneb. Some stars are faint but still visible without much difficulty with direct vision. The clouds were slowly coming from West. I decided to move to South for the last observations.
M4	Sco	Glob CL	28x	I was not able to detect this cluster. I suspect the reason was that it is too low in the sky for my TV-60 and Antares brightness did not help either. Therefore I decided to focus on the beautiful open cluster of this region of Sky, which was the only area not affected by clouds and actually transparent. 
M8	Sgr	CL+Neb	28x	Lagoon Nebula. About 1-1.5 degree large, this is a very nice cluster with nebulosity. I did not have a OIII filter with me, but the nebula was detectable without filter. It appeared a soft gray patch surrounding the cluster. This cluster is quite elongated. Superb.
M20	Sgr	CL+Neb	28x	Trifid Nebula. Positioned at North of M8, M20 is a bit smaller, but still impressive. Also here, the nebulosity was detectable and the shape of the cluster was elongated connecting M20 with M21.
M21	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	M21 was a condensed group of stars on one extremity of M20. M8, M20 and M21 are really spectacular targets.  
M23	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	This cluster was a little bit at North-West from M21. It was a bit dim, but if the sky were more transparent and darker it would be a lovely target, I think.
M25	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	This cluster showed a mix of bright and dim stars. The size is sufficient for the Nag13 and the details are quite rich.
M16	Ser	CL+Neb	28x	Eagle Nebula. After seeing M25, I moved North-West towards M16. This appeared quite bright with some stars at the centre. 
M17	Sgr	CL+Neb	28x	Omega Nebula. From the Eagle Nebula, I simply moved South and saw this target. It is a bit smaller than the Eagle, but still bright. 
M18	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	A small open cluster at South of Omega Nebula.
M24	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	Sagittarius Star Cloud. Impressive and large group of stars. Really spectacular. It covered a field of almost 2 degrees populated by stars. The surrounding stars were quite bright. Globally this appeared as a bright area with a few faint stars.

Venus	Com	Planet	28x, 72x, 103x	Observation at twilight. Phase about 40%. Again, the Vixen revealed a wonderful Venus. Very crisp on the border and a clear arc defining the phase. A few times I had the impression of a slightly darker patch on the clouds located in the South hemisphere near the centre centre of the planet. This happened with Venus at different position in the eyepiece. At 103x Venus was still a pleasure to see, but not as much as at 72x. At 28x the phase was clearly there too, and the image was still crisp.
Jupiter	Leo	Planet	72x, 103x	Observation at twilight. All four moons were visible tonight. At 72x 4 belts were detectable and colours were also visible. These appeared as brown-red for the belts and slightly darker white for the zones. At 103x the image was a bit degraded compared to 72x. I believe the Vixen SLV is just a tiny but noticeable bit better than the nagler 3.5mm
Saturn	Lib	Planet	18x, 28x, 72x, 103x	Observation at twilight. At 72x, Titan was clearly visible and appeared yellow-orange. The planet appeared yellow globally, whereas one the North Equatorial Belt was more orange. The Cassini division was detectable on the lateral parts of the rings and the Ring A was distinguishable from the Ring B, due to the difference colour intensity. At 103x, no additional detail was visible, but the Cassini division was still there on the lateral parts. At 28x, the rings were visible and well separated from the planet. Titan's colour was a bit more orange. It is really interesting that these colours appear much more evident when the sky is clear rather than dark. I believe this is due to the eye cones which are more active than the eye rods. At 18x, I could not really distinguish the rings from the planet, although the non spherical shape was observable. No additional moon was detectable at these low powers. 
Moon	Vir	Satellite	28x, 72x, 103x, 206x	Observation at twilight. Waxing crescent at about 40%. At 72x, the Moon was really beautiful and crisp. Very soft little clouds passed over the South hemisphere and the view was really suggestive. At 103x, some more detail were visible, although these were somehow lost at 206x due to the non perfect seeing which did not allow to get a perfect focus. At 28x, the Moon appeared as a lovely target floating on the sky. The ultra wide field of the Nagler 13mm really shows the Moon and the surrounding context.

Moon	Oph	Satellite	72x, 103x, 206x	Observation at twilight. Waxing Gibbous, 94%. The moon was not very crisp tonight due to a little layer of high clouds caused by the high temperature during the day. I moved from Montes Apenninus to Copernicus. A small crater was visible inside, but many details on the circular border were not clear. Therefore I moved to Kepler as this was farther East hoping to improve the visible contrast. This showed a little shadow on one border. At 206x, from Kepler I moved North-East, following the crater chain formed by Kepler C, Marius D, F, A, C, and B. All these craters are relatively small and close to each other. Finally I moved North reaching Aristarchus which appeared beautiful. This white crater shows an impressive contrast and is close to a little half circle of hills at North-East and a dark crater (Herodotus) at East. Really nice view.

Venus - Jupiter	Com	Planet	28x, 72x, 103x	Observation at twilight. Conjunction Venus-Jupiter. The two planets were about 0.3 / 0.5 degrees apart. Venus was largely brighter and bigger than Jupiter. Venus phase was less than 40%. The planet border was well defined. Jupiter bands were only visible at low power (28x) due to the mediocre seeing. It was possible to see 3 satellites but the sky was still too bright for detect them easily. It was nice to see this conjunction, but unfortunately the seeing did not allow sufficient resolution for Jupiter which was not easy to focus. At 28x the North and South Equatorial belts were visible in the early evening. It was an interesting conjunction but not as great as the one I saw when I was teenager. At the time the two planets were elongated at naked eye. It was spectacular.
Saturn	Lib	Planet	72x	Observation at twilight. Due to the poor seeing, I did not push magnifications higher than 72x. Even at this zoom, the planet was not very crisp. 
Moon	Oph	Satellite	72x, 144x, 206x	Observation at twilight. Waxing Gibbous and phase 97%. I observed Tycho, Copernicus and Kepler. 
NGC6910	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	From Deneb (Alpha), I moved to Sadr (Gamma). This open cluster is on the line between these two stars, but on the side of Sadr. Its size is only 8', but is sufficiently bright (magnitude 7.4, surface brightness 11.7). It is formed by few bright stars and I could count about 7-8 dim stars. Apparently, many of these stars are variable. Very beautiful to me. 
M29	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	Cooling Tower. From Sadr (Gamma), this cluster is East - South-East. The main six stars forming a little tower, or an academic hat, were easily visible. No dim star was detectable likely due to the Moon. This is a nice cluster which might be interesting to see at higher power (e.g. 51x). 
IC4996 - Cr418	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	From M29, I moved South. This is a very small open cluster which is detectable at this low power, but would benefit of higher power. It is near an isolated star near three pairs of aligned stars. Three - four stars were detectable apart from the main one.
NGC6883 - Cr415	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	From IC4996, I moved South, using as a reference a group of stars reminding me of a pan and a long handle. NGC6883 is located below a line of 3 stars. It is quite easy to find.
NGC6871	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	From NGC6883, I moved South-West. There is a chain of about 8-10 stars, leading to this wonderful open cluster. The cluster is of medium size. I could see about 10-15 blue bright stars, and 3-4 pairs seemed to be double stars. There are also lovely double stars in this area.

Saturn	Lib	Planet	28x, 51x, 72x, 103x 	Observation at twilight. At 28x I could spot the rings and Titan. At 51x Saturn was very crisp but not additional detail was detectable. At 72x, the North Equatorial Belt and the Cassini division on the lateral rings were visible. At 103x those gained details were somehow lost unfortunately. Saturn was lovely at 72x.
NGC6871	Cyg	Opn CL	28x, 51x	I tried to see this wonderful open cluster again at both 28x and 51x. It is a fantastic cluster with the faint Milky Way dust in the background. 3-4 pairs of double stars were visible. All the bright stars are blue. Really nice.
M29	Cyg	Opn CL	28x, 51x	Cooling Tower. At 51x the cluster revealed 2-3 dim stars but not much else. The full moon did not help though.
M39	Cyg	Opn CL	28x, 51x	Great open cluster of medium size. About 20-25 bright stars were visible and other 20-25 faint stars detectable. This is a nice open cluster with a decent size, shape and a mixture of bright and dim stars.
NGC7082	Cyg	Opn CL	28x, 51x	Although this cluster is a bit smaller than M39, it is much less evident. It is located at South of M39 and where the lines made from two pairs of stars intersecate. Nice to see, but far less spectacular than M39.
NGC7086	Cyg	Opn CL	28x	Located 3-4 degrees North of M39 and above the star 80 Cyg (Azelfafage, mag 4.75), this cluster is just above a curved chain of stars. It is a small open cluster made of dim stars.
Mu	Cep	Star	28x	Hershel's Garnet Star. Bright red supergiant star located next to IC1396. Magnitude 4.2. It is the biggest star visible at naked eye.
IC1396	Cep	CL+Neb	28x +/- OIII, 51x	Elephant's Trunk Nebula. I tried to reach this open cluster from M39, but I wrongly arrived at Alpha Cep (Alderamin). Star hopping from Alderamin was much easier. Although the nebula was not visible with the OIII filter, it was nice to see this cluster. In front of the Garnet Star, there is a chain of stars. The brightest is a tight system of three stars of different luminosity. Really nice to see and already split at 28x. This was well separated at 51x. Nearby this system there is another double star where the components have different brightness. Almost all, if not all these stars but the Garnet Star, are blue.
NGC7235	Cep	Opn CL	28x	From the Garnet Star, I moved East until I reached Zeta Cep. From there in the same field I gradually moved South. There are three bright stars as a reference. Between Zeta Cep and these three stars there is this little open cluster formed by dim stars. 
NGC7261	Cep	Opn CL	28x	Two of the three stars previously mentioned are double stars (I think!). To find NGC7261 I moved along the line depicted from these three stars on the side of the double star on the corner (the one located at East). This cluster was also small and made of 3-4 dim stars. 
Delta	Cep	Dbl Star	28x	Very close to the cluster above, continuing along that immaginary line, I found this beautiful easily split double star. One component is orange, whereas the other is blue. The brightness is different between the two and in particular the blue star is dimmer. This double star is a little gem and reminded me of Beta Cyg (Albireo).

Saturn	Lib	Planet	28x, 51x, 72x, 103x 	Observation at twilight. At 72x, the North Equatorial Belt was easily visible. The Cassini division was detectable at the lateral sides of the rings, and the rings A and B were clearly distinct. Titan was visible and appeared like a small star. At 28x or 51x the planet looked crisper, but the NEB was not easily detectable. At 103x the Cassini division was not visible. The seeing was not good enough for higher power, unfortunately.
IC4665 - Cr349	Oph	Opn CL	28x	Summer Beehive Cluster. Wonderful open cluster, close to Beta Oph (Cebalrai). Always worth having a look if in the area.
61	Oph	Dbl Star	28x	From Beta Oph (Cebalrai), I moved South towards Gamma Oph. 61 Oph is a double star located at about 1 degree East of Gamma Oph. It is already split at 28x. It seems to me that they were both blue but with slightly different magnitude. The sky was not completely dark, so I might be wrong. Nice pair. 
M8	Sgr	CL+Neb	15x +/- UHC or OIII, 28x	Lagoon Nebula. At 28x the stars in this cluster with nebula are much better separated. I decided to use a low power eyepiece on the nebulae in this area. The OIII was too strong mainly because the sky was not dark enough and this target is just above the horizon. Instead a UHC was ideal and revealed the nebula via direct vision clearly. This is one of my favourite targets in Sagittarius. 
NGC6530	Sgr	Opn CL	15x +/- UHC, 28x	Cluster inside / East the Lagoon Nebula. This cluster emerges at 28x to me. 
M20	Sgr	CL+Neb	15x +/- UHC, 28x	Trifid Nebula. The Southern part of this nebula benefitted from the UHC filter and showed a patch of cloud around the cluster. The Northern part of the nebula was not visible instead. 
M25	Sgr	Opn CL	15x +/- UHC, 28x	This is a nice open cluster of medium size. Some star are bright, others much dimmer.
M17	Sgr	CL+Neb	15x +/- UHC, 28x	Omega Nebula. The nebula was clearly visible at 15x with direct vision. It appeared as a small but quite dense cloud.
M16	Ser	CL+Neb	15x +/- UHC, 28x	Eagle Nebula. This nebula was only visible with averted vision. Whereas I did not see much difference in the Omega Nebula between averted and direct vision, for the Eagle Nebula averted vision showed a much wider nebula extension.
NGC6604	Ser	CL+Neb	15x +/- UHC, 28x	This cluster with associated nebulosity is located at about 1.5 degrees North of the Eagle Nebula. It is a fairly spread cluster without many stars. The nebula shape was not really identifiable, but it was possible to spot the presence of diffuse nebulosity in the area. 
M24	Sgr	Opn CL	28x	Sagittarius Star Cloud. I counted about 50 stars, althought the sky was not dark yet. Fantastic cluster
M29	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	Cooling Tower. Easily detectable as it is in the same field of view of Sadr. It is at about 2 degrees South from Sadr and 2 degrees East from the Cygnus' neck.
IC4996 - Cr418	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	From Sadr, follow the line forming Cygnus' neck. This object is located at about 1.5-2 degrees East from the Cygnus' neck. It is easily detectable at 15x.
NGC6883 - Cr415	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	As for IC4996.
NGC6871	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	As for IC4996.
C27 - NGC6888	Cyg	Neb	15x +/- UHC or OIII	Crescent Nebula. The nearby group of stars is located on the Cygnus' neck at about 1.5 degrees from IC4996 (from IC4996, just move 1.5 degrees North-West). Spotting the nebula was difficult though. I suspect it requires a darker sky. With averted vision and a UHC filter, very faint small grey patches were suspected around the nearby stars. A OIII filter made these patches slightly more noticeable. However, in my opinion this seems to be a challenging target.
M27	Vul	Pln Neb	15x +/- UHC	The Dumbell Nebula. This planetary nebula is clearly distinguishable from the background sky and shows up like a grey ball. No detail at this magnification was visible though. Really pretty target.
C20 - NGC7000	Cyg	Neb	15x +/- UHC	North America Nebula. The presence of diffuse nebulosity was visible in the area, but it was not obvious to spot the presence of this nebula specifically. 
C33 / 34 - NGC6992 / 6960	Cyg	SN Rem	15x +/- OIII	Veil Nebula. I did not spot it. After positioning at 52 Cyg, I gradually moved in the surrounding area at South, but was not able to spot any nebulosity. As for the Crescent Nebula, this is a challenging target and I believe it requires darker skies. 
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
HIP87937	Oph	Star	28x	Barnard's Star. Red dwarf star. 6 ly distant from Earth, it is the second closest star to our Solar System. 
Mu	Cep	Star	28x	Hershel's Garnet Star. 
Delta	Cep	Dbl Star	28x	Very close to the cluster above, continuing along that immaginary line, I found this beautiful easily split double star. One component is orange, whereas the other is blue. The brightness is different between the two and in particular the blue star is dimmer. This double star is a little gem and reminded me of Beta Cyg (Albireo).
