Sun	Gem	Star	28x, 51x, 72x, 103x	It was generally windy, but sometimes the wind was mild for a few minutes. There were not many sun spots today. One was located at about the centre and was formed by a penumbra region followed by four little spots. A little bit North of this spot region, there was a chain of six spots. Faculae were detectable around these two areas when the wind was calm. 51x was generally the best magnification for today, whereas 72x could be used when the wind was mild.

Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
Beta	Sco	Dbl Star	15x, 28x	Acrab. Nice double star. The colours were not very clear because of the low position just above the horizon. Still very pretty though. Already split at 15x
Omega	Sco	Dbl Star	15x, 28x	Largely separated double star, if it is a double.
Nu	Sco	Dbl Star	15x, 28x	This is tighter than Beta, but at 28x the two stars are separated.
M11	Sct	Opn CL	15x, 28x, 51x, 72x	The first time I observe M11 this year. Gorgeous. Stars were visible with averted vision at 51x and 72x. At this last magnificaiton, the cluster appeared really nice and clear. Apart from the limited field of view, it seems to me that the Vixen SLV works really nicely also on DSO.
NGC6992/ 6960	Cyg	SN Rem	15x +/- OIII, 28x + OIII	Veil Nebula. At 28x (2.2mm exit pupil) + OIII, the nebula was difficult to identify. The view improved by choosing an exit pupil of 4mm. Without OIII the nebula is completely invisible. With the OIII, the Eastern component was easier to see than the western. The sky was not completely dark and the was some haze in the sky.
NGC7063	Cyg	Opn CL	15x, 28x	I casually found this open cluster when exploring the sky in Cygnus. It a medium-small open cluster with about 10-15 stars visible directly and others via averted vision. Quite pretty.
NGC6940	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	Large spread open cluster. I was a bit disappointed when I saw this open cluster as it did not show any striking feature, but just a collection of disconnected stars of similar magnitude, luminosity and colour. 
NGC6871	Cyg	Opn CL	15x	Just passing across Cygnus' body and I stopped on this lovely open cluster. 
M39	Cyg	Opn CL	15x, 28x	Nice medium size open cluster. 20-25 stars visible. Others required averted vision.
NGC7082	Cyg	Opn CL	15x, 28x	Open cluster close to M39. It is spread and its stars do not have specific features.
