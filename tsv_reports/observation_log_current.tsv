Jupiter	Cnc	Planet	103x +/- SPF, 206x + SPF	Just a quick look until the sky became darker. No particular event tonight. It was very nice to see it. The two main bands revealed some subtle detail appearing like tiny shades. In particular these were more detectable for the main band in the North Hemisphere.  
Moon	Sgt	Satellite	103x +/- SPF	Phase 96%. No many detail were revealed. The moon is not really interesting when full. Craters and seas were detectable but not immersive. 
M57	Lyr	Pln Neb	103x	Ring nebula. The ring was visible with averted vision, but no other detail really. The contrast between the ring and the internal area is much more visible with an OIII filter. Still nice planetary nebula.
Zeta Lyr	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Already split at 15x, but much nicer at 103x. 
Delta Lyr	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	This is a very nice system of stars already visible at 15x. A larger triangle with a little internal triangle. Just beautiful.
Epsilon Lyr	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x, 206x	Epsilon 1 and 2 were easily split at 15x. At 103x it was possible to detect that both Epsilon 1 and 2 are double stars themselves. At 206x this pair of tight double stars was visible although these double stars remained very close. Same colour.
Beta Lyr	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Sheliak. Splendid double already split at 15x. This was very nice at 103x. 
Beta Cyg	Cyg	Dbl star	15x, 103x	Albireo. Wonderful double. A bit tight at 15x, but very nice at 103x. One orange, the other one blue.

Sun	Tau	Star	51x +/- VPF or SPF, 72x +/- VPF, 103x +/- VPF	I enjoyed observing the Sun a lot today. There were more than 30 sunspots and also a hint of granulation when the wind became calm for short moments. Very nice day. The wind did not allow to see Sun granulation most of the time. The seeing improved after 5pm when the wind became more moderate. Many sunspots were visible. Three larger umbrae were surrounded by nice areas of penumbra. One of this had an irregular shape and the South part vanished gradually. This at all powers. It was very attractive. A central area contain 4 well defined sunspots and many little grey spots. Around the larger sunspots, there were brighter and extended areas on the Sun surface. 51x gave the best view most of the time. 72x and 103x were interesting powers but only suitable when the wind was calm, which was rare! A VPF increased the detail noticeably. Apart from reducing image brightness, I appreciate this filter because it stabilises the image, particularly under average seeing. Surprisingly I found that I prefer the view through a SPF rather than VPF. A VPF reduces image brightness, whereas a SPF improves contrast to me. Through a SPF I could see a hint of granulation at 51x even when there was moderate wind. This did not happen with a VPF. I am considering whether separate the two filters. Having them separate would also be quite comfortable when watching planets in the twilight. SPF also improved contrast for all the sunspots. This works as follows: 0 (or 180) degrees shows the brightest image, 90 (or 270) degrees shows the darkest image. For observing both planets and the Sun, I found that I prefer the view when the SPF is positioned at 45 (or 135 or 225 or 315) degrees. The image was still bright, contrast was highest than all other options and the number of details was maximised. Nagler 7mm, Vixen 5mm, and Nagler 3.5mm form my best eyepiece combination for watching the Sun with the TV-60. All of them are really useful, although the first two achieve best results almost every time. The Nagler 3.5mm can show some very nice close-up of umbrae and penumbrae.

Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
Saturn	Lib	Planet	103x	Seen during civil twilight and later in the nautical twilight. Although the seeing was not great, Saturn appeared very crisp. The rings had a very nice inclination. The Cassini division was generally not detectable. For few seconds when the seeing stabilised, a hint of dimmer colour was visible on the external part of the rings. A nice band was visible all the time on the North Hemisphere of the planet. Titan was visible too. The view was really nice generally. Possibly due to the seeing, but I preferred the view when the sky was darker. 
Alpha Sco	Sco	Star	15x	Antares. Lovely red star. I could see the Airy disc and difraction rings very nicely. Antares is one of my favourite stars. 
M107	Ser	Glob CL	15x, 51x	From Han, Zeta Oph, go slightly South and see a triangle. M103 is on the outside of one of the verteces. It was barely visible at 15x, also due to the bright sky. At 51x was detectable but still with difficulty. Not much to see. Just a grey smudge visible with averted vision.
M10	Oph	Glob CL	15x, 51x	Nice globular cluster. It does not have nearby stars, but is relatively large. Stars are not really visible, but the cluster appear with some hint of granulation particularly detectable on the outside.
M12	Oph	Glob CL	15x, 51x	Like M10, this is another nice globular cluster. Somehow I preferred it to M10 because of the presence of surrounding close stars at east. I believe this cluster is slightly bigger than M10, or at least it seemed so. Like M10, a hint of granulation was detectable. 
IC 4665 - Cr349	Oph	Opn CL	15x	Summer Beehive cluster. Amazing open cluster of large size above the star Cebalrai. A pleasure to see with a low power eyepiece. Stars have similar colours and magnitude, but the shape is nice.
NGC 6633	Sct	Opn CL	15x	From 71-72 Oph to East, NGC 6633 and Cr386 appear in succession. Both are sufficiently large to be appreciable with a low power eyepiece. They are quite rich in stars. 
IC 4756 - Cr386	Sct	Opn CL	15x	Graff's cluster. See above
Epsilon Lyr	Lyr	Dbl star	51x	Double Double. I could not split at 51x. The image suggested a possible elongation of the two stars, but I would not bet on this if I did not know they are doubles.
Beta1 Sco	Sco	Dbl star	51x	A very nice double star at 51x. The two stars have different colour and brightness. If I remember correctly the small one was blue. They were split but still quite tight. At 70x they should be split clearer.
