v2.0.0

After the first prototype this release is more about refactoring internal components of AstroJournal than introducing new features. A summary describing the work applied for this releases is provided below.

- Re-design of the configuration package. This now has a clear pipeline of tasks to do at initialisation. The singleton pattern was replaced by a normal class. This changes the way that modules communicate with each other, and increases flux control and safety. The configuration parameters are now stored as Java properties. Configuration files are saved in xml. Modularisation of program constants.
- Re-design of the generator package. Here a generator includes a specific set of importers and exporters. Importers and Exporters now communicate with a better and simpler data structure which allows importer and exporter extensions. Two new simpler types of generators are introduced in order to import and export less data and show compact reports. These can be useful for giving a quick overview via shorter documents. 
- Importers and exporters now are much more extensible and flexible.
- Exporters and importers are dynamically loaded.
- Increased number of configuration parameters.
- Constants are now stored in enum types.
- Improved log messages and notifications at all levels.
- Increased the number of jUnit tests and adoption of Travis-CI in development.
- Fixed several bugs.
