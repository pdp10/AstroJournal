\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, Venice, Lorenzago (IT). Newcastle, Luton Devon, Cambridge, (UK). 1 to 3, 3 to 5. Celestron Newton 114mm F8; Binoculars 15x70; Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. B15x70, Newcastle (UK).
\item 30/06/2015 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Cooling Tower. From Sadr (Gamma), this cluster is East - South-East. The main six stars forming a little tower, or an academic hat, were easily visible. No dim star was detectable likely due to the Moon. This is a nice cluster which might be interesting to see at higher power (e.g. 51x). 
\item 02/07/2015 21:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 51x. Cooling Tower. At 51x the cluster revealed 2-3 dim stars but not much else. The full moon did not help though.
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. Cooling Tower. Easily detectable as it is in the same field of view of Sadr. It is at about 2 degrees South from Sadr and 2 degrees East from the Cygnus' neck.
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. Cooling Tower. About 8 stars were visible, 2 were very faint.
