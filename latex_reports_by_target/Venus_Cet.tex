{\bf Venus, Cet, Planet}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 24/03/2015 19:00-21:30, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 3 - Somewhat clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 72x, 144x. 144x was too much. Possibly because the planet was too low, or because the eyepiece did not cool down properly. In any case, even at 72x, no planet atmosphere detail. 
\end{itemize}
