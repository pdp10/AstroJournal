{\bf Boo, Epsilon, Dbl star}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15/06/2015 21:45-0:30, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 72x. Izar. I could not split this double star at 28x or 72x. I thought it was easier. Still a very nice yellow bright star. The sky was becoming less transparent on this region of the sky. Therefore I moved North.
\end{itemize}
