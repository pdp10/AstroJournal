{\bf NGC869/ 884, Per, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, Venice, Lorenzago (IT). Newcastle, Luton Devon, Cambridge, (UK). 1 to 3, 3 to 5. Celestron Newton 114mm F8; Binoculars 15x70; Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 51x. Double Cluster. B15x70, Exeter, Newcastle (UK); TV60F6, Newcastle (UK).
\item 30/04/2015 22:00-23:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 51x. Double cluster. Superb cluster. Even if low in the sky, it was a pleasure to see it. At 51x, the cluster emerged from the background and showed more faint stars.
\item 12/05/2015 21:00-23:45, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Double Cluster. Again, the Nagler 13 offering almost 3 degrees of fov shows the full object with great detail but conserving an adequate image brightness. 
\item 20/05/2015 21:30-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Double Cluster. This target is superb with the Nagler 13. Although low on the horizon, it still offers nice contrast with the background sky and the 2.8deg of fov show the object with all its context.
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Double Cluster. As already found before, 28x and 2.7 degrees of field of view shows this target as a real gem. It is wonderful.
