{\bf Cep, Delta, Dbl Star}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 02/07/2015 21:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Very close to the cluster above, continuing along that imaginary line, I found this beautiful easily split double star. One component is orange, whereas the other is blue. The brightness is different between the two and in particular the blue star is dimmer. This double star is a little gem and reminded me of Beta Cyg (Albireo).
\end{itemize}
