{\bf M3, CVn, Glob CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 26/05/2015 21:15-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. As all the globular cluster seen with a small telescope, M3 also appears like a little grey cloud. This is a bright globular cluster and a hint of 'granulation' is perceptible although no star can be resolved. Not very easy to find due to the lack of bright stars to star hop from Arcturus.
