{\bf M25, Sgr, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15/06/2015 21:45-0:30, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. This cluster showed a mix of bright and dim stars. The size is sufficient for the Nagler 13 and the details are quite rich.
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x +/- UHC, 28x. This is a nice open cluster of medium size. Some star are bright, others much dimmer.
\item 07/07/2015 22:30-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. This cluster is located at about 4-5 degrees West from M24. To me this is one of the best open cluster in this area. It is surrounded by bright stars, but dimmer stars are also present.
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. Much more compact than M24, but this target shows stars of different magnitude really nicely.
