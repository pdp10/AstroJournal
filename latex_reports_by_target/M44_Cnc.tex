{\bf M44, Cnc, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12/05/2015 21:00-23:45, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. The Nagler 13mm offers the best view. Its fov covers the whole object nicely. Image not degraded at all and the background sky was darkened just the right amount for maximising contrast. Exit pupil of about 2.0mm shows a really nice brightness / contrast for point source DSO.
