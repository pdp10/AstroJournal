{\bf Saturn, Lib, Planet}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 51x, 72x, 103x . Observation at twilight. At 72x, the North Equatorial Belt was easily visible. The Cassini division was detectable at the lateral sides of the rings, and the rings A and B were clearly distinct. Titan was visible and appeared like a small star. At 28x or 51x the planet looked crisper, but the NEB was not easily detectable. At 103x the Cassini division was not visible. The seeing was not good enough for higher power, unfortunately.
