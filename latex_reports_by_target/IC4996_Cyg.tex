\item 30/06/2015 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. From M29, I moved South. This is a very small open cluster which is detectable at this low power, but would benefit of higher power. It is near an isolated star near three pairs of aligned stars. Three - four stars were detectable apart from the main one.
