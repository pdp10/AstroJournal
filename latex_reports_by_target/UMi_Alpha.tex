\item 13/05/2015 21:00-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 103x. Polaris. A nice target because of the large difference in brightness between the two stars. Polaris' companion was dim grey and detectable at 28x with some difficulty. 103x easily split the two stars.
