{\bf M60, Vir, Galaxy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 13/05/2015 21:00-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. It was detectable with averted vision at 28x. It appeared as a grey patch without a structure. I tried M58, but it was not visible. I believe that to see these targets with this small telescope, very dark skies are required.
