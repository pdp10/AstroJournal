{\bf M60, Vir, Galaxy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12/05/2015 21:00-23:45, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Turn West to Vindemiatrix. A little crown of star is visible slightly South. Continue and you see a little arrow of stars and a single star in the North. M60 is between these two objects. Not detectable at 15x. Detectable via averted vision at 28x. A patch of grey. The sky was not fully dark though and my eye was not dark adapted. I believe this object can show more detail. 
\item 13/05/2015 21:00-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. It was detectable with averted vision at 28x. It appeared as a grey patch without a structure. I tried M58, but it was not visible. I believe that to see these targets with this small telescope, very dark skies are required.
\end{itemize}
