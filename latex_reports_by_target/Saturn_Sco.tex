{\bf Saturn, Sco, Planet}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 20/05/2015 21:30-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 103x, 206x. It is still fairly low on the horizon. Titan was visible. The Cassini division was not detectable, but it was possible to see a shade in the middle of the ring. At 206x the image was just degraded and difficult to focus. I have to wait for a higher position of the planet.
