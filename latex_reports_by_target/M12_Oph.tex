{\bf M12, Oph, Glob CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, See location(s) later. Moderate to perfect seeing, Moderate to clear transparency. See telescope(s) later, 15x. B15x70, Newcastle (UK).
\item 10/06/2015 22:00-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 51x. Like M10, this is another nice globular cluster. Somehow I preferred it to M10 because of the presence of surrounding close stars at east. I believe this cluster is slightly bigger than M10, or at least it seemed so. Like M10, a hint of granulation was detectable. 
\end{itemize}
