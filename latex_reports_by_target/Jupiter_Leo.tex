{\bf Jupiter, Leo, Planet}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 23/06/2015 21:40-23:15, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 72x, 103x. Observation at twilight. All four moons were visible tonight. At 72x 4 belts were detectable and colours were also visible. These appeared as brown-red for the belts and slightly darker white for the zones. At 103x the image was a bit degraded compared to 72x. I believe the Vixen SLV is just a tiny but noticeable bit better than the nagler 3.5mm
