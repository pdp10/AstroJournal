{\bf M81, UMa, Galaxy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, See location(s) later. Moderate to perfect seeing, Moderate to clear transparency. See telescope(s) later, 15x. Bode's Galaxy. B15x70, Newcastle (UK).
\item 26/05/2015 21:15-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Bode's nebulae. Not easy to find it at 15x with half moon, but M81 and M82 were detectable via star hopping from Dubhe. At 28x this large galaxy shows its core and a bit of brightness on the body. I was very impressed at seeing these two targets and I believe M31, M32, M101, M81, and M82 are the most appreciable galaxies for small telescopes. Averted vision improved the visibility of this target significantly.
