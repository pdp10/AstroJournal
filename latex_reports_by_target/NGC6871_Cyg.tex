{\bf NGC6871, Cyg, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 30/06/2015 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. From NGC6883, I moved South-West. There is a chain of about 8-10 stars, leading to this wonderful open cluster. The cluster is of medium size. I could see about 10-15 blue bright stars, and 3-4 pairs seemed to be double stars. There are also lovely double stars in this area.
\item 02/07/2015 21:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 51x. I tried to see this wonderful open cluster again at both 28x and 51x. It is a fantastic cluster with the faint Milky Way dust in the background. 3-4 pairs of double stars were visible. All the bright stars are blue. Really nice.
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. As for IC4996.
