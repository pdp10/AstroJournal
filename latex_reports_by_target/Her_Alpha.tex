\item 07/07/2015 22:30-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 72x, 103x. Rasalgethi. A real gem. Superb double star. The bright component is orange, whereas the second component appears green. They are already split at 72x, but I preferred the view at 103x where they are split more clearly.
