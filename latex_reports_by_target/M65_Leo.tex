{\bf M65, Leo, Galaxy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 14/04/2015b 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 18x. This object requires aperture and dark sky to be detected and viewed properly. Just very faint object visible through averted vision. An exit pupil of 3.3mm is better than 4.0mm. I wonder whether something between 2.5 and 2.0mm can improve this view even more.
