{\bf Omega, Sco, Dbl star}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15/06/2015 21:45-0:30, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 72x. The two stars were largely more separated than Acrab double stars. A no substantial difference in colour or size was noticeable though. I did not find this target particularly interesting. Nicer at 28x.
\item 22/07/2015 22:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Largely separated double star, if it is a double.
\end{itemize}
