{\bf M82, UMa, Galaxy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 26/05/2015 21:15-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Cigar galaxy. Its elongated shape was visible. It was amazing to see this galaxy and its neighbour M81 in the same field. These two targets are going to become one of my favourite objects.
