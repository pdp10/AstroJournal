{\bf Venus, Com, Planet}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 23/06/2015 21:40-23:15, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 72x, 103x. Observation at twilight. Phase about 40\%. Again, the Vixen revealed a wonderful Venus. Very crisp on the border and a clear arc defining the phase. A few times I had the impression of a slightly darker patch on the clouds located in the South hemisphere near the centre centre of the planet. This happened with Venus at different position in the eyepiece. At 103x Venus was still a pleasure to see, but not as much as at 72x. At 28x the phase was clearly there too, and the image was still crisp.
