{\bf M13, Her, Glob CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, Venice, Lorenzago (IT). Newcastle, Luton Devon, Cambridge, (UK). 1 to 3, 3 to 5. Celestron Newton 114mm F8; Binoculars 15x70; Tele Vue 60 F6, 36x; 15x, 51x. Hercules Globular Cluster. C114F8, Venice (IT); B15x70, TV60F6, Newcastle (UK).
\item 12/05/2015 21:00-23:45, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x. Detectable at 15x, but nicer at 28x. No star was resolved. It would be interesting to try 51x although I guess this might be too much. 
\item 26/05/2015 21:15-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Same as M3. Very bright and large globular cluster. Some granulation is perceptible but no star could be resolved.
