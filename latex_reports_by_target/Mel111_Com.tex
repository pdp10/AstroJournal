\item 14/04/2015b 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. Coma Berenices star cluster. Located just south of Gamma Com, this large object is as spectacular as M44. Very rich of stars, some bright some small and fainting. Some are doubles. As this is a large object, 15x is the adequate magnification. As Coma Berenices does not have bright stars, you can find this object knowing that is between Denebola (Leo) and Cor Caroli (Alpha CVn).
