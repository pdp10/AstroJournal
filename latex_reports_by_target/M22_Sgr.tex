{\bf M22, Sgr, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 07/07/2015 22:30-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 51x. Large globular cluster quite similar to M13 in Hercules. There is a little star triangle at South West from this cluster. At about 2.5 degrees in the same direction there is Lambda Sgr (Kaus Borealis), a fairly bright star shining at magnitude 2.8. At 51x a hint of granulation was perceptible but no star was really resolved. Really beautiful.
