{\bf NGC188, UMi, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 13/05/2015 21:00-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. The detail of this target seemed accessible, but I did not manage to see anything in the position suggested by Stellarium. Unfortunately, I did not have a star atlas with me. 
\end{itemize}
