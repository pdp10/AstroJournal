{\bf Moon, Vir, Satellite}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 23/06/2015 21:40-23:15, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 72x, 103x, 206x. Observation at twilight. Waxing crescent at about 40\%. At 72x, the Moon was really beautiful and crisp. Very soft little clouds passed over the South hemisphere and the view was really suggestive. At 103x, some more detail were visible, although these were somehow lost at 206x due to the non perfect seeing which did not allow to get a perfect focus. At 28x, the Moon appeared as a lovely target floating on the sky. The ultra wide field of the Nagler 13mm really shows the Moon and the surrounding context.
