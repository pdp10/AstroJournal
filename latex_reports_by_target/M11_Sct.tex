{\bf M11, Sct, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, See location(s) later. Moderate to perfect seeing, Moderate to clear transparency. See telescope(s) later, 15x. Wild duck cluster. B15x70, Newcastle (UK).
\item 22/07/2015 22:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x, 51x, 72x. The first time I observe M11 this year. Gorgeous. Stars were visible with averted vision at 51x and 72x. At this last magnificaiton, the cluster appeared really nice and clear. Apart from the limited field of view, it seems to me that the Vixen SLV works really nicely also on DSO.
