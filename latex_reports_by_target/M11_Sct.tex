{\bf M11, Sct, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item xx/xx/1998 Mar 1998 to Jan 2015, Venice, Lorenzago (IT). Newcastle, Luton Devon, Cambridge, (UK). 1 to 3, 3 to 5. Celestron Newton 114mm F8; Binoculars 15x70; Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x. Wild duck cluster. B15x70, Newcastle (UK).
\item 22/07/2015 22:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 4 - Partly clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 28x, 51x, 72x. The first time I observe M11 this year. Gorgeous. Stars were visible with averted vision at 51x and 72x. At this last magnificaiton, the cluster appeared really nice and clear. Apart from the limited field of view, it seems to me that the Vixen SLV works really nicely also on DSO.
