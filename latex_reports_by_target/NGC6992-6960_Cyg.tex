{\bf NGC6992/ 6960, Cyg, SN Rem}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x + OIII. Veil Nebula. The first time I observe this target and it is gorgeous. The Eastern part nicely emerged from the sky. The shape and some features were visible with direct vision, although other minute details, mainly about the extension, were accessible via averted vision. The Western part above 52 Cyg was also visible via direct vision. The Northern part was more difficult although the presence of nebulosity was detectable. Tonight the sky was very clear and sufficiently dark (nautical twilight). A bit of Milky Way was visible on Cygnus at Naked eyes. Superb.
