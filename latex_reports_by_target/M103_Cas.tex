{\bf M103, Cas, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12/05/2015 21:00-23:45, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Not sure whether I saw M103 or NGC457 (the Owl Cluster) though. A clear double star was well visible and there were a few dim stars in the background were also detectable. This object starts being visible at 28x. It is relatively small, but a lovely target. I think it was M103 as my memory seems more similar to the images.
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. This cluster has less impact than NGC663, but is still pretty. It is more compact than NGC663.
