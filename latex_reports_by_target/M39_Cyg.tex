{\bf M39, Cyg, Opn CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15/06/2015 21:45-0:30, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Quite large open cluster position at North North-East of Deneb. Some stars are faint but still visible without much difficulty with direct vision. The clouds were slowly coming from West. I decided to move to South for the last observations.
\item 02/07/2015 21:50-0:00, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x, 51x. Great open cluster of medium size. About 20-25 bright stars were visible and another 20-25 faint stars detectable. This is a nice open cluster with a decent size, shape and a mixture of bright and dim stars.
