{\bf M16, Ser, CL+Neb}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15/06/2015 21:45-0:30, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 28x. Eagle Nebula. After seeing M25, I moved North-West towards M16. This appeared quite bright with some stars at the centre. 
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x +/- UHC, 28x. Eagle Nebula. This nebula was only visible with averted vision. Whereas I did not see much difference in the Omega Nebula between averted and direct vision, for the Eagle Nebula averted vision showed a much wider nebula extension.
\item 17/07/2015 23:30-3:00, Cambridge, UK. 1 - Perfect seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x +/- UHC or OIII. Eagle Nebula. As previously found, the UHC seems to work better on these targets. I believe it is due to the lower position and to the sky which is not fully dark. The OIII largely shrank the nebulosity. Beautiful target as always.
