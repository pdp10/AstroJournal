{\bf M8, Sgr, CL+Neb}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 05/07/2015 21:50-0:20, Cambridge, UK. 3 - Moderate seeing, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x +/- UHC or OIII, 28x. Lagoon Nebula. At 28x the stars in this cluster with nebula are much better separated. I decided to use a low power eyepiece on the nebulae in this area. The OIII was too strong mainly because the sky was not dark enough and this target is just above the horizon. Instead a UHC was ideal and revealed the nebula via direct vision clearly. This is one of my favourite targets in Sagittarius.
