{\bf M53, Com, Glob CL}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 14/04/2015b 21:30-23:20, Cambridge, UK. 2 - Slight undulations, 5 - Clear. Tele Vue 60 F6, 15x, 18x, 51x. This object is not easy to find. It is just 1-2 degrees east of Diadem (Alpha Com), but this star is very dim to be seen, unless the sky is enough dark. Instead use the Virgo trapezium and point to north following the star Vindemiatrix (Virgo). You can find Diadem just going some degree north from Vindemiatrix. M53 appears as a little grey cloud at 15x. No detail of this globular cluster is visible. At 18x, the contrast is a bit improved, but the image is the same. At 51x this objects  is larger and well detectable, but still appears like a grey cloud.
