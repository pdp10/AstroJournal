M42	Ori	CL+Neb	15x	Great Orion Nebula. M42 benefits from both UHC and OIII filters, but in different way. The OIII shows a sublime image where the border between the nebula and sky background really emerges. The same can be said about the North part (that one linked to M43). In the centre of the nebula, some 'waves' were also visible. It is a super target to my eye. The UHC shows a much larger extension for this nebula and this is amazing with a wide field telescope. Small fine details visible within the nebula with the OIII are less obvious with the UHC, but the nebula just appears as massive globally and faint details on the outside borders are accessible as pure diffuse bright areas. 
NGC2244	Mon	Opn CL	15x	Satellite cluster. Six stars in two columns 
NGC2237	Mon	Neb	15x	Rosette nebula. Detectable with OIII filter. Very soft grey patch. No structure. Invisible with UHC filter.
Jupiter	Cnc	Planet	129x	A bit of wind, but the image stays crisp at high magnifications. No aberration.

Location	Cambridge, UK			
Altitude	12m			
Temperature	3C (no wind)			
Seeing	2 - Slight undulations

Telescopes	Tele Vue 60 F6			
Eyepieces	TV Panoptic 24mm, Nagler 7mm, Powermate 2.5x			
Filters	Astronomik OIII			
Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
M45	Tau	Opn CL	15x, 51x	Very clear and defined. 15x offers the best fov.
M42	Ori	CL+Neb	15x + OIII, 51x	Well balanced contrast at 15x with OIII. 51x shows trapezium
Sigma	Ori	Mlt star	51x	Sufficient for seeing 5 stars
NGC1980	Ori	Neb	15x + OIII	With 4mm exit pupil, OIII shows a bit of nebula around the star Hatsya
NGC2244	Mon	Opn CL	15x	Satellite cluster. Six stars in two columns 
NGC2237	Mon	Neb	15x + OIII	Rosette nebula. Detectable with OIII filter. A grey patch 2 degree large. No structure visible
M96	Leo	Galaxy	15x	Unsuccess
Gamma	UMi	Dbl Star	15x	Pherkad. Blue 3mag. It has a neighbour star 10.30mag. Pherkad Minor orange 5mag.
Eta	Dra	Dbl Star	15x	2.7mag and 6.05mag
M51	CVn	Galaxy	15x	Whirlpool Galaxy. From UMA-Alkaid, move south to 24CVn. Continue on that direction until HIP65768. This forms a triangle with HIP66004 and HIP66116. They are all 7mag stars. HIP65768 is the brightest in the area. M51 lies externally of the line between HIP65768 and HIP66004. Averted vision for 10min is required. You will see a grey patch. No structure.
Jupiter	Cnc	Planet	129x	Order: Europa, Callisto, Jupiter, Io, Ganymede. Two belts very visible. The lower one was visible on the left (refractor). On the right the great red spot was detectable. Very minor belts north and south. 
Ceres	Sgr	Asteroid	51x	Test to see whether this work.
