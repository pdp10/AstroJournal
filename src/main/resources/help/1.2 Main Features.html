<h1>Main Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Support for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows users.
<li>A simple graphical interface for running the program is provided.
<li>Generation of a PDF document containing all user observation records collected by increasing target catalogue number. This is useful for comparing targets observed over time.
<li>Generation of a PDF document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is useful for visualising one's observations by session.
<li>Generation of a PDF document containing the targets observed by constellation. This is useful for checking observed and unobserved targets by constellation.
<li>Generation of a txt document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is for creating observation reports to be published in an astronomy forum (e.g. Stargazers Lounge).
<li>Complete lists of Messier objects and Caldwell selection of NGC targets are included at the end of the generated PDF documents.
<li>Although the program requires some form of structured input file, this is intentionally minimal in order to not distract the user who wants to insert his / her data rather than thinking of how to format this data. All input data is treated as a string and therefore is not parsed for controls. This leaves the freedom to the user to introduce the data content as s/he wish. For instance, although in each document header I use the Antoniadi Scale for Seeing, this can be trivially overridden with a customised one. The inserted value for the seeing is not controlled according to a specific scale.
<li>Possibility to edit the document header and the footer according to one's need. This must be done in LaTex for preserving the format controls in the final output file.
