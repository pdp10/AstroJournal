<p>
Here are some guidelines for using AstroJournal:
<ol>
<li>Report your observations (with the structure of my tsv or csv file) using a 
spreadsheet program, such as MS Excel, Libreoffice Spreadsheet, or Google 
Spreadsheet. Alternatively you can use a common text editor (e.g. Wordpad, 
GNU Emacs, Kate, etc.) as long as the fields are the same as in the samples 
provided in the raw_report and that each field is separated using a TAB character.</li>
<li>Export your file as tsv (if using Google Spreadsheet) or csv. In the latter 
case, when asked, select tab as field delimiter.</li>
<li>Put this file in the folder raw_reports.</li>
<li>In the main astrojournal folder click on the icons (or type the command) ./run_astrojournal.sh (GNU Linux / Mac OS X) or 
run_astrojournal.bat (Windows).</li>
<li>Press the button "Create Journals". </li>
</ol>
