{\bf Target} & {\bf Cons} & {\bf Type} & {\bf Power} & {\bf Notes} \\ 
\hline 
Moon & Vir & Satellite & 51x, 103x & Moon phase 91\%. The moon at 103x did not need a filter. It was very crisp and showed details in the South hemisphere despite it was almost full. At 51x, the moon is simply scaled of a factor of 1/2, indicating that the Nagler 3.5mm behaves as a perfect 2x Nagler 7mm. It would be useful to have a Moon map to check the crater's names.  \\ 
Jupiter & Cnc & Planet & 103x & At 103x Jupiter showed 4 moons and 4 belts. No specific events were visible this evening. \\ 
M44 & Cnc & Opn CL & 15x & Beehive cluster. One of the best wide open cluster. Not many faint stars were visible because of almost full moon. However, the cluster still emerged in the sky. \\ 
C14 - NGC869 / 884 & Per & Opn CL & 15x, 51x & Double cluster. Superb cluster. Even if low in the sky, it was a pleasure to see it. At 51x, the cluster emerged from the background and showed more faint stars. \\ 
Stock2 & Cas & Opn CL & 15x & This cluster next to the double cluster is very nice and needs a wide field telescope. Its stars are not so bright and generally of similar magnitude and colour. \\ 
Mel20 & Per & Opn CL & 15x & Alpha Per moving cluster. Wide field telescopes or binoculars are the best for this superb cluster. Even if low in the sky, it was very beautiful to see. >70 stars detectable. \\ 
C39 - NGC2392 & Gem & Pln Neb & 15x, 51x & Eskimo nebula. At 15x it was detectable with averted vision. It was easily visible at 51x and appeared like a fuzzy blue/grey small patch next to the star.  \\
