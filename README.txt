Object:
=======
This Java program generates Latex code from the tab-separated value (tsv) files containing astronomy observations edited in Google Drive.



Using AstroJournal:
===================
To use AstroJournal you need to install:
- Java 1.6+
- TeX Live (pdflatex or texi2tex must be installed)
You can download AstroJournal here. After downloading and uncompressing the file, you can execute AstroJournal on GNU/Linux typing:
./create_journal.sh.



History of AstroJournal:
========================
v0.5
- extracted Latex header and footer from Java code
- added additional controls
- bug fixes
- increased code modularity
- renamed observations/ and tsv_files/ into latex_reports/ and tsv_reports/
- source code cleaning
v0.4
- wiki links point to the last version directly. No need to update each time 
- simplified scripts for creating journal
- renamed this software 'AstroJournal'
- added controls before using pdflatex or texi2tex
- imported Latex code for observations prior to the log
- reversed the observations (now most recent first)
- renamed .tex and .pdf to lowercase names
- improved legends layout
- bug correction
- improved table layout
- simplified build.xml

v0.3
- add latex command for showing tables on multiple pages ( http://users.sdsc.edu/~ssmallen/latex/longtable.html )
- Draw of your own images to replace the existing ones. However, I decided to omit images so the pdf is lighter and faster to load on the browser
- use tsv_files and observations outside of dist/ . Not necessary to copy these two folders into dist/ . Therefore, you only keep your data in one place. Simplified build.xml to have jar file in the current directory

v0.2
- improved code in Observation.java and ObservationItem.java
- input/output folders tsv_files/ and observations/ passed as parameters
- simplified tsv file structure
- corrected importation of multiple observations per day

v0.1
- creation of Latex code for all your observation
- reading of different tsv files sequentially and ordered by date increasing is supported. In this way, you can create an observation log per month or two (keeping the google spreadsheet short), and add the exported tsv file to the folder tsv_files




Iced features:
==============
- improve code for importing an observation without being dependent on AJMain.


Open bugs:
==========


Close bugs:
===========
- Latex long table can generate an empty page if the current table spans until the end of the page. This empty page should be removed. [SOLVED] Replaced \begin{centre} ... \end{centre} with \centering for longtable



Thanks for using AstroJournal!

Use case
========
# 1. edit your observation using a SpreadSheet (e.g. Google Drive);
# 2. save your observations as .tsv (tab separated values) and put this .tsv file in the folder tsv_reports/;
# 3. run the following command for creating or updating the journal
./create_journal.sh
# 4. run the following command for versioning the new files (just me).
./push_obs_git.sh
