\begin{abstract}
This document contains a collection of observation reports. It is auto-generated by running Java program AstroJournal (https://pdp10@bitbucket.org/pdp10/astrojournal.git) and the utility pdflatex (or texi2pdf). AstroJournal generates Latex code from tab-separated value (tsv) files exported using a SpreadSheet (e.g. Google Drive SpreadSheet). This allows users to: a) edit their observation reports using a spreadsheet easily, b) obtain a complete and formatted report in Latex, and c) benefit from versioning (if using a versioning system such as Git).

\noindent 
{\bf Atlases:}
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Deep Sky Hunter Star Atlas v2 (by Michael Vlasov)
\item Sky \& Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas (by Roger W. Sinnott)
\item Carte du Ciel (software)
\item Stellarium on tablet (software)
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip 
{\bf Observing techniques for DSO:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eye adaptation at the eyepiece for 10min at least 
\item Averted vision 
\item Cover the other eye to relax the observing eye nerve 
\item Know exact target position (precise star hopping) 
\end{enumerate} 
\bigskip 
{\bf Antoniadi Scale:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perfect seeing, without a quiver.
\item Slight undulations, with moments of calm lasting several seconds.
\item Moderate seeing, with larger air tremors.
\item Poor seeing, with constant troublesome undulations.
\item Very bad seeing, scarcely allowing the makings of a rough sketch.
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip 
{\bf Transparency Scale (American Association of Amateur Astronomers):}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do Not Observe - Completely cloudy or precipitating. (Why are you out?)
\item Very Poor - Mostly Cloudy. 
\item Poor - Partly cloudy or heavy haze. 1 or 2 Little Dipper stars visible. 
\item Somewhat Clear - Cirrus or moderate haze. 3 or 4 Little Dipper stars visible. 
\item Partly Clear - Slight haze. 4 or 5 Little Dipper stars visible. 
\item Clear - No clouds. Milky Way visible with averted vision. 6 Little Dipper stars visible. 
\item Very Clear - Milky Way and M31 visible. Stars fainter than mag 6.0 are just seen and fainter parts of the Milky Way are more obvious 
\item Extremely Clear - overwhelming profusion of stars, Zodiacal light and the gegenschein form continuous band across the sky, the Milky Way is very wide and bright throughout
\end{enumerate}
