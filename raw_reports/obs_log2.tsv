Target	Cons	Type	Power	Notes
Jupiter	Cnc	Planet	129x +/- SPF	Just a quick look until the sky became darker. No particular event tonight. It was very nice to see it. The two main belts revealed some subtle detail appearing like tiny shades. In particular these were more detectable in the North Equatorial Belt.  
Moon	Sgr	Satellite	129x +/- SPF	Phase 96%. No many detail were revealed. The moon is not really interesting when full. Craters and seas were detectable but not immersive.
M57	Lyr	Pln Neb	51x, 129x +/- OIII	Ring nebula. The ring was visible with averted vision, but no other detail really. The contrast between the ring and the internal area is much more visible with an OIII filter. Still nice planetary nebula.
Zeta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 129x	Already split at 15x, but much nicer at 129x. 
Delta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 129x	This is a very nice system of stars already visible at 15x. A larger triangle with a little internal triangle. Just beautiful.
Epsilon	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 129x	The Double Double. Epsilon 1 and 2 were easily split at 15x. At 129x it was possible to detect that both Epsilon 1 and 2 are double stars themselves. Same colour.
Beta	Lyr	Dbl star	15x, 129x	Sheliak. Splendid double already split at 15x. This was very nice at 129x. 
Beta	Cyg	Dbl star	15x, 129x	Albireo. Wonderful double. A bit tight at 15x, but very nice at 129x. One orange, the other one blue.

Sun	Tau	Star	51x, 72x +/- VPF	I enjoyed observing the Sun a lot today. There were more than 30 sunspots and also a hint of granulation when the wind became calm for short moments. Very nice day. The wind did not allow to see Sun granulation most of the time. The seeing improved after 5pm when the wind became more moderate. Many sunspots were visible.
