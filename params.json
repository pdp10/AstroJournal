These tables \r\nare saved in .tsv or .csv format files and imported by AstroJournal. Once imported, the program will export this information by category (reports by date, by target, by constellation) in PDF format using LaTeX.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Main Features\r\n- Generation of a PDF document containing all user observation reports collected by increasing target catalogue number. This is useful for comparing targets observed over time.\r\n- Generation of a PDF document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is useful for visualising oneâ€™s observations by session.\r\n- Generation of a PDF document containing the targets observed by constellation. This is useful for checking observed and unobserved targets by constellation.\r\n- Generation of a TXT document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is for creating observation reports to be published in an astronomy forum (e.g. Stargazers Lounge).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nTo use AstroJournal you need to install:\r\n\r\n- [Java 1.7+](https://java.com/en/download/)\r\n\r\n- [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) (for GNU/Linux users only)\r\n \r\n- [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/download) (for Windows users only)\r\n\r\n- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (for Mac OS X users only)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThe latest stable version of this software application can be downloaded here:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/pdp10/AstroJournal/zipball/master](https://github.com/pdp10/AstroJournal/zipball/master)\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and uncompressing the file, run AstroJournal by typing:\r\n```\r\n# On GNU/Linux or Mac OS X run AstroJournal typing (or clicking):\r\n./astrojournal.sh\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\n# On Windows, click:\r\nastrojournal.exe\r\n```\r\nThis will start a simple graphical user interface to generate the journals.\r\n\r\nThe user manual for the software AstroJournal can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pdp10/AstroJournal/blob/develop/doc/user_manual.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional notes for installing AstroJournal dependencies:\r\n\r\nOn GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu 14.04+, users can install the LaTeX dependencies required by AstroJournal with the following command:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended\r\n```\r\nOn Windows, users should install MikTeX and then the LaTeX packages *url* and *mptopdf* using MikTeX Manager.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X, users should install MacTeX. I have not tested this directly. If the command *pdflatex* is not available, I think it should be possible to create a link called *pdflatex* to the corresponding program used by MacTeX to compile LaTeX code.\r\nIn addition, to run AstroJournal on a MAC OS X platform, some steps are required since Mac OS X still uses Java 1.6 while AstroJournal requires Java 1.7+: \r\n- Download the latest Java from [https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp](https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp);\r\n- Follow the procedure for installing the package.\r\n- Unfortunately, Mac OS X installs this version of Java as Plugin, and this is not in the $PATH environment variable.\r\nTo correct this, 1) open the application Terminal; 2) type *nano ~/.bash_profile* ; 3) write at the beginning of the file the following instruction: *export PATH=/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/:$PATH* (there is a SPACE after *Internet\\*) ; 4) hold the button *Control* while pressing the button *x* ; 5) press the button *y* (Yes) ; Press the button *Enter* / *Return* ; 5) close Terminal. To test: start Terminal and type *java -version*. It should report a version above 1.6. As of the time this README was written, it prints *java version \"1.8.0_66\"*. This procedure is required for the first time only. \r\n- Download AstroJournal, unzip the file, and enter the application folder.\r\n- Enter the folder *target*. \r\n- Click *astrojournal-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar*\r\n- Mac OS X will ask for permissions to execute the file. Answer *Yes*. This may require the user to disable special controls in Mac OS X in *System Preference > Security & Privacy*. In particular at least the radio box *Mac App Store and identified developers* should be selected. \r\n- AstroJournal should start correctly now. ",
