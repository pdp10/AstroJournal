This is useful for comparing targets observed over time.\r\n- Generation of a PDF document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is useful for visualising oneâ€™s observations by session.\r\n- Generation of a PDF document containing the targets observed by constellation. This is useful for checking observed and unobserved targets by constellation.\r\n- Generation of a TXT document containing all user observation reports collected by decreasing date. This is useful for copying and pasting reports with any text editor.\r\n- Extraction of basic statistics from the reports.\r\n\r\n### Download and Run\r\nThe latest stable release of AstroJournal can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pdp10/AstroJournal/releases/latest). \r\n\r\nA user manual is provided with the package in the doc folder.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and uncompressing the file, open the folder and run AstroJournal as follows:\r\n```\r\n# On GNU/Linux or Mac OS X type or click:\r\n./astrojournal.sh\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\n# On Windows, click:\r\nastrojournal.exe\r\n```\r\nThis will start a simple graphical user interface to generate the journals. To run AstroJournal via command line, \r\n```\r\n# On GNU/Linux or Mac OS X type:\r\n./astrojournal.sh -c\r\n```\r\nPlease use the option -h (--help) to see the available options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nTo use AstroJournal you need to install:\r\n\r\n- [Java 1.7+](https://java.com/en/download/)\r\n\r\n- [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) (for GNU/Linux users only)\r\n \r\n- [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/download) (for Windows users only)\r\n\r\n- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (for Mac OS X users only)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional notes for installing AstroJournal dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu 14.04+\r\nUsers can install the LaTeX dependencies required by AstroJournal with the following command:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended\r\n```\r\nThe creation of a deb package is currently in progress.\r\n\r\n##### Windows\r\nUsers should install MikTeX and then the LaTeX packages *url* and *mptopdf* using MikTeX Manager.\r\n\r\n##### Mac OS X\r\nUsers should install MacTeX. I have not tested this directly. If the command *pdflatex* is not available, I think it should be possible to create a link called *pdflatex* to the corresponding program used by MacTeX to compile LaTeX code.\r\nIn addition, to run AstroJournal on a MAC OS X platform, some steps are required since Mac OS X still uses Java 1.6 while AstroJournal requires Java 1.7+: \r\n- Download the latest Java from [https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp](https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp);\r\n- Follow the procedure for installing the package.\r\n- Unfortunately, Mac OS X installs this version of Java as Plugin, and this is not in the $PATH environment variable.\r\nTo correct this, 1) open the application Terminal; 2) type *nano ~/.bash_profile* ; 3) write at the beginning of the file the following instruction: *export PATH=/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/:$PATH* (there is a SPACE after *Internet\\*) ; 4) hold the button *Control* while pressing the button *x* ; 5) press the button *y* (Yes) ; Press the button *Enter* / *Return* ; 5) close Terminal. To test: start Terminal and type *java -version*. It should report a version above 1.6. As of the time this README was written, it prints *java version \"1.8.0_66\"*. This procedure is required for the first time only. \r\n- Download AstroJournal, unzip the file, and enter the application folder.\r\n- Enter the folder *target*. \r\n- Click *astrojournal-x.x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar*\r\n- Mac OS X will ask for permissions to execute the file. Answer *Yes*. This may require the user to disable special controls in Mac OS X in *System Preference > Security & Privacy*. In particular at least the radio box *Mac App Store and identified developers* should be selected. \r\n- AstroJournal should start correctly now. \r\n",
